look at vocably.js

Need to uncomment most of the OAuth code and get the liquid OAuth js helpers working. 
Look at the github link in the requirements.txt for more info on the OAuth helpers. 
ChildBrowser is included in order to let the application handle the OAuth popup form.
ChildBrowser can only be tested on a phone (emulated or real)

Once authenticated and we have the Access Token, we are yet to decide what to do with it.

We can:
a. use token, download email and POST email to server.
b. POST or put the token in the URL to server and let the server download the email.

option B and sending it via the URL is currently the simplest. The server preferably receives the Access Token on each GET of .../words.json (so we know who the user is), and preferably over HTTPS (else we are giving sniffers access to our emails). 

URL's and Google API keys/secrets need to be modified to correspond to the deployment environment. Testing needs several components to be setup:
- All the Google OAuth keys, callback URLS etc.
- emulated or real Android phone with a network connection.
- server with the appropriate interfaces as described above.

Happy testing!


NB: To install the APK on a real phone, it needs to be signed. A vocably certificate was generated and it is included. Ask Vaughn for the password, but you should already know it.
